# LegitiPrefix
LegitiPrefix LegitiAll your LegitiWords in your LegitiMessages for no LegitiReason

## WHAT IS THIS!?
Random mod for a server based on a joke where we prefix some words with "legiti"

## How?
Turns out figuring out the type of word you are using is very difficult, I had to use a machine learning toolkit called OpenNLP to figure out the types of words, and whitelist certain types of words to prefix.

## Why?
As stated previously, we had a joke where we prefixed some words with "legiti", based on the name of the server: "legitimoose".
